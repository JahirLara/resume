    <h2>Technology teacher and web developer</h2>
    <p>
        Empathetic and joyful, that's how I would describe myself. I have 3 years of experience as a middle school teacher and I've learned that I really love to work teenagers.
        Having a background in customer service has allowed me to comunicate assertively with my students. <br>
        I also love teamwork and learn from everyone around me. I believe all my working experience provides me with different perspectives and allows me to solve
        problems in many different ways.
